## Simple instructions for getting multiple git accounts on one Windows computer

These instructions assume you have a "normal" git account for everyday use, but need to use a second (for contributing to your local github from your work machine or vice versa.) This will assume all of your code is in a "HomeCode" directory.
1. Go to your gitconfig. By default, it should be in `%USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig`
1. Add the following:
    ```
    [includeIf "gitdir:**/HomeCode/**"]
      path = .gitconfig-homecode
    ```
1. Create the new file `.gitconfig-homecode` with the following contents:
    ```
    [user]
      name = Your Name
      email = youremail@domain.tld
    ```
1. Proceed with clone/checkout/commit in the HomeCode directory. At some point you should be asked for your password, which once provided should apply to any future changes made to that directory.
